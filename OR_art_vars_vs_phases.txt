The following are my conclusions on usage of the artificial
variables algorithm vs using phase 0 and phase 1.

The function used to test this is entitled
    compare_art_vars_and_phases
and the methodology used was as follows:
    -given a set of M values and N-M values to test for, each
    combonation was tested
    -in the tests, a M+1 by N+1 tableau is generated and solved
    using the simplex method
    -this tableau then has it's rows randomly permuted in a way
    that preserves the solution to the problem
    -both the artificial variables algorithm and the phases
    algorithm are then timed to get a canonical form tableau and
    the simplex method is used to solve this tableau
    -accuracy of each method is checked by if these solutions
    match up to the original solution
    -this is repeated a preset number of iterations that scales
    with tableau size in order to not take too long

Conclusions:
    -the accuracy of both methods were exactly the same every test
    -the phases algorithm was faster on average for the tests
    -the closer that the tableau is to square, the faster the larger
    the relative difference in time (with the phases algorithm
    faster)
    -when N-M gets very large, the artificial variables algorithm
    begins to go faster than the phases

My conclusion is that the phases algorithm is superior for most cases.
