As requested, my suggested revisions for the "Network Models
conclusion" handout.

The main revision that I would like to suggest is to not use
a linked list for each node to contain the costs. This is because
the GNF algorithm requires repeatedly lookup of the costs for each
edge and this operation would cost O(n) for a linked list.

In my implementation, I chose to use a n by n matrix to store the
pairwise costs resulting in O(1) complexity to look up the cost.
The downside of this appraoch is a O(n^2) space complexity, which
is a waste especially if the graph is sparse.

The best option would be a hashtable which allows O(1) lookup
complexity as well as O(n) space complexity.
